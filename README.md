# Slack WII

Basically a slack client for the Wii!!

## Architecture

Because the wii isn't powerful enough to download images, cache a lot of data or doesn't support tls, there is actually a backend server that can run on basically everything on your home network (an old android phone, raspberry pi, whatever really...) (microcontroller support one day maybe).

- The backend (written in go ofc)
- The wii homebrew app (written in C++ with libogc)

## Features

- Is a slack client

## Installation

Uh honestly? idk :)

## Disclaimer

Probably a terrible way to do it and not very secure, but if it works /hj
